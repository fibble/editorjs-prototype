# VOL EditorJS Demo with GOV.UK Prototype Kit

A demonstration of how EditorJS can be integrated with the GOV.UK Prototype Kit for creating editable letters/responses in a form flow.

## Overview

This prototype demonstrates how to implement EditorJS within the GOV.UK Prototype Kit. It enables users to:

1. Select issues they wish to add to a letter
2. Edit content for each selected issue using the EditorJS rich text editor
3. View a summary of their responses after submission

This is similar to how caseworkers might pick issues to add to a VOL letter, to edit before sending
